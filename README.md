# Amazon Web Services Training

This is a two-day course that teaches the basics of [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com). The content is split into individual modules. As a whole, the course focuses on EC2, VPC, IAM, RDS, S3 and CloudFormation, with brief looks into rest of the services.

The course guides participants roughly towards the [Solutions Architect certification](http://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/), but expands slightly more towards software development, than what is required in the certification. In the later modules, we will take a look at a Java web application that consists of several backend services, and we will deploy it to AWS as an auto-scaling cluster of servers.

## Getting started

For modules 1-4, a laptop with a browser and SSH client is enough. Modules 5-8 include programming assignments that require JDK 8, IDE and Ansible. See the [Getting Started](docs/getting_started.md) for information on how to prepare for the programming workshop and how to set up your tools.
